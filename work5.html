            <p> <br>I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior <br> knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks,<br> I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also <br>master the soft skills required for being a software developer.<br>
                    So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing<br> push in my career as a software developer.<br>

            <p> Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get <br>in the real world space. 
                I had an immense learning that was really <br>different from the self learning I started with. 
                The learning was <br>fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were <br>presented to us. 
                I got my first gig immediately after the program.<br>
                <br>Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.<br>

                <p><br>I bless the day the Instagram algorithm pop up Tech Studio<br> Academy to my news feed. 
                    I read through their curriculum and <br>other details about the Bootcamp and I told myself this is <br>the opportunity I've been waiting for.<br>
                    I wasn't disappointed, the environment was well ventilated and <br>conducive, with competent instructors. Here I am today at OT&T <br>Consulting, fulfilling my dreams thanks to Tech Studio Academy.<br>
